# A "Slice" of Magic

## 5 Ways to Celebrate Pi Day with Your Little Geniuses

On March 14th (3.14), mathematicians and dessert lovers alike unite for Pi Day. While it might sound like a "school" holiday, at Pixie Parties, we know that any excuse for a theme is an excuse for a magical experience!

Whether you’re hosting a small playdate or a full-blown "Math-querade," here are five ways to celebrate the infinite fun of Pi with your kids.

## The Ultimate Pizza "Pi" Party

Why wait for dessert? Start the celebration with a savory circle. Making homemade pizza is a fantastic way to engage kids in the kitchen.
	
**The Activity:** Give each child their own round of dough.
	
**The Lesson:** Before you add the sauce, use a piece of string to measure the distance around the edge (the circumference) and across the middle (the diameter).
	
**Pixie Tip:** Being well-organized and stress-free is key. Have toppings pre-chopped in small bowls so the kids can focus on the creative "design" of their pizza!

## The Great Hula Hoop Contest

Pi is all about circles, and what’s more circular than a Hula Hoop? This is the perfect activity to burn off some of that energy.    
	
**The Challenge:** See who can keep their hoop spinning the longest.    

**The Twist:** To make it extra "Pi-themed," try to see if anyone can reach 31 seconds or 3.14 minutes (for the older kids!).
	

## "The Perfect Circle" Art Studio

Can you draw a perfect circle without a compass? It’s harder than it looks!    
	
**The Activity:** Set up an art station with markers, crayons, and paper. Have kids try to draw circles freehand, or use circular household objects (cups, rolls of tape, coins) to create a "Bubble Art" masterpiece.    

**The Pixie Touch:** This is where we see the "creative and flexible" spirit that people love in our performers. Let the kids turn their circles into flowers, planets, or even colorful "Floating Lanterns" inspired by Rapunzel!
	
## 3.1415926535...

How many digits of Pi can your little ones remember?
   
**The Game:** Turn it into a song or a rhythmic chant.

**The Reward:** For every digit they memorize, they get a small treat (like a chocolate chip or a sticker). It’s a fun way to keep them "engaged and focused," much like our character visits!

## Baking (and Eating!) Real Pie

Of course, it wouldn't be Pi Day without the edible kind. Baking a pie is a lesson in patience and precision.
	
**The Pro-Tip:** If you’re managing a large crowd consider doing "Mini Hand Pies." They are easier for small hands to hold and mean no messy slicing is required!
