## Planning a Bubbly Glinda-Themed Party

Step into a world of pink, glitter, and good intentions! A Glinda party theme is all about celebrating kindness, self-confidence, and a little bit of *defying gravity*.

## 🌟 Glittering and Glamorous Decorations
The key to a Glinda party is embracing opulence and shine.

* Color Palette: Use varying shades of pink, white, silver, and gold. Think iridescent shimmer over primary colors.
* Bubble Magic: Use a **bubble machine** near the entrance to set a whimsical, floaty atmosphere. Alternatively, hang clear balloons from the ceiling to look like floating bubbles.
* Wand Workshop: Set up a station with ribbon, glue, and glitter for children to decorate their own star-tipped magic wands to take home.
* Thrones: Decorate a special chair with pink tulle and sparkling lights to serve as Glinda's "Throne."

## 🪄 Magical Games and Activities
Every activity should center around goodness, glamour, or casting simple spells.

* Bubble Dance-Off: Play upbeat, whimsical music and have the children dance around, trying to keep a bubble from popping using only gentle puffs of air.
* Goodness Granting: Have each child write one nice thing about the birthday child or another party guest on a little heart-shaped piece of paper.

## 🧁 Beautiful and Bubbly Bites
The food should look elegant, whimsical, and perfectly pink.

* Pink Bubbly Drink: Pink lemonade or white grape juice mixed with a dash of soda, served in plastic champagne flutes.
* Glinda's Good-Witch Cakes: Cupcakes topped with towering pink frosting, edible silver glitter, and a tiny plastic wand.
* Emerald City Veggies: A tray of green vegetables (cucumbers, celery, green pepper strips) served with a white dip.
