# The Ultimate Guide to Booking a Character Performer

## Timing, Tipping, and Hidden Costs

Hiring a character performer is the key to creating a truly magical birthday memory. But for first-time bookers, the process can feel a little mysterious. How far in advance do you need to book? What about tipping? And what exactly are "hidden costs"?

At Pixies Parties, we believe in clear communication. Here is your definitive, professional guide to planning and booking your Calgary character visit without any surprises.

## Timing is Everything: When to Secure Your Date

The single biggest factor in stress-free party planning is booking early.

- **Standard Booking (3-6 Weeks Out):** This is generally a safe window for weekdays and most weekend slots outside of major holidays. You’ll have a good selection of characters and package times.
- **Peak Season Booking (8-12 Weeks Out):** If your party falls during peak times (October/Halloween, December holidays, or June graduations), or if you want a highly sought-after character like Queen Elsa or Cinderella, aim for this window. Saturdays often book up first!
- **Last-Minute Booking (1-2 Weeks Out):** While we always try to accommodate, last-minute bookings often limit your choices to available performers and times, sometimes leading to a slight rush fee. Always check our real-time availability first!

*Pro Tip: Once you have your venue and desired date, book your character immediately. Don't wait until the invitations are sent.*

## Navigating Travel Fees (The Non-Hidden Cost)

A character performer's fee covers the performance time, but travel costs are a standard industry practice, especially when travelling outside the performer's home city.

- **Why Travel Fees Exist:** This fee covers the performer’s time and gas to drive to and from your specific location, including costume preparation and de-rigging time. It ensures they arrive on time and in character, even when driving across the city.
- **Know Your Zone:** Most professional companies offer a free travel zone (usually central Calgary). If you are in the surrounding areas, like Airdrie, Chestermere, or Okotoks, you will incur a fee.
- **Always Check:** You can find the specific travel zones and current fee structure laid out clearly on our Calgary Travel Fees page. We never want this to be a surprise cost!

## Tipping: The Etiquette of Appreciation

Tipping is one of the most common questions we receive, and it is always appreciated but never expected.

<table class="table table-striped">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th><p>When Tipping is Common</p></th>
			<th><p>Why Parents Tip</p></th>
			<th><p>Average Range</p></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Exceptional Service</strong></p></td>
			<td><p>The performer went above and beyond (e.g., helped calm a nervous child, stayed longer for photos, handled an unexpected situation gracefully).</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>$10 - $20 per performer</strong>, or 10-15% of the total package price.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>High Effort</strong></p></td>
			<td><p>The performer was engaging for the entire duration, managed a large or difficult group, or performed a special request (like a complex song).</p></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Cash or E-transfer</strong></p></td>
			<td><p>Either is acceptable! If paying by cash, discretely give it to the handler or an adult family member at the end of the visit.</p></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

## Setting the Stage: Environment and Logistics

A great party experience relies on the environment you create for the performer.

- **Parking & Access:** Ensure the performer has an easy, designated parking spot close to the entrance. This allows them to quickly and discreetly enter and exit the party without their character magic being spoiled.
- **The 'Reveal' Location:** Designate a quiet, private area (like a separate room or a washroom) where the performer can put on any final costume elements and make their grand entrance. This keeps the magic alive!
- **Dedicated Space: Characters** thrive in a designated performance area. Clear a space in your living room or rental hall where they can lead games, sing, and interact without being too crowded.
