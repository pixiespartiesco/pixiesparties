# Luck of the Pixie

## Hosting a Magical St. Patrick’s Day Party for Kids

When March 17th rolls around, the world turns a vibrant shade of emerald. While St. Patrick’s Day is often celebrated with parades and pub crawls, it’s also one of the most imaginative holidays for children. After all, what could be more exciting than the hunt for a hidden pot of gold or the quest to catch a mischievous leprechaun?

If you’re hosting a St. Paddy's celebration in Calgary, here is your guide to creating a day filled with "Lucky" memories.

## The Great Leprechaun Hunt

Capture the imagination of your little guests by setting up a scavenger hunt.

**The Clues:** Use small green footprints (cut from construction paper) to lead the way. To make it more challenging for older kids, create some riddles for them to solve.

**The Treasure:** Instead of just candy, hide "gold" chocolate coins or shiny pebbles painted gold.

**The Pixie Touch:** Having a structured break from the chaos is vital. Having a Garden Fairy or a Magical Character arrive to lead the hunt ensures the kids stay on track and engaged rather than just running wild!

## "Green" Themed Snacks

Make the menu part of the fun!

**Shamrock Shakes:** Mint-infused milkshakes topped with green sprinkles.

**Rainbow Fruit Platter:** Arrange strawberries, oranges, pineapple, grapes, and blueberries in a bow shape, with a bowl of marshmallows (clouds) at one end and gold coins at the other.

**Clover Sandwiches:** Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to create three "leaves" and a small stem.

## Irish Jig Dance-Off

Music is the heart of St. Patrick’s Day. Clear a space in the living room for a "Lil' Leapers" dance session.

**The Activity:** Teach the kids a simplified version of an Irish jig.

**The Character Advantage:** Professional entertainers like Pixies Parties are experts at managing a crowd with ease. Having a character lead the dancing ensures everyone participates and keeps the high energy channeled into a fun performance.

## Crafting the Rainbow

Set up a craft station where children can make their own "Luck Charms."

**Pots of Gold:** Small terracotta pots painted black and filled with yellow tissue paper.

**Beaded Rainbows:** Using pipe cleaners and multi-colored beads to create wearable rainbows.

**Sensory Play:** Much like the sensory-friendly work we do with Autism Calgary, St. Patrick's Day can be celebrated through green-dyed rice bins or "shamrock" scented playdough for a calming, tactile experience.

> ## Why Character Magic Makes the Difference
> 
> St. Patrick’s Day is rooted in folklore and storytelling. Having a character like Cinderella or a Fairy visit your party to share tales of magic and kindness adds a layer of depth to the "leprechaun" antics.
> 
> A professional character visit makes the day stress-free for parents while making the birthday child feel special. Whether it’s a March birthday or just a community celebration, a little extra pixie dust makes the holiday truly golden.
> 
> Feeling Lucky? Our March calendar is filling up faster than a leprechaun can disappear! [Book your St. Patrick's Day character today](/#packages "Book your St. Patrick's Day character today") and let us bring the luck to you.
