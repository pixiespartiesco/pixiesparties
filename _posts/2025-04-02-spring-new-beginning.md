# Best Day Ever

## Bringing the Magic of Spring to Life with Rapunzel

As the snow melts in Calgary and the first hints of green appear in our gardens, there is a collective sense of "new beginnings" in the air. For parents planning birthdays during this season, there is no character who embodies the spirit of spring better than Rapunzel.

After all, she knows exactly what it’s like to finally step out of a tower and experience the "grass and dirt, just like I dreamed they'd be!"

## A Breath of Fresh Air for Your Party

Spring parties often transition from indoor living rooms to sunny backyards.

Rapunzel’s high energy and adventurous spirit make her the perfect "guide" for children who are ready to burn off some winter energy. She doesn't just sit and tell stories; she brings the outdoor world to life.

## Springtime Activities with the Tower Princess

When Rapunzel visits your spring celebration, she brings a basket full of sunshine and creativity:

1. The "Floating Lantern" Craft
    While real lanterns might be for the evening, Rapunzel leads the children in creating their own sun-themed crafts. It’s a wonderful way to encourage the "creative and flexible" play that our performers, like Erin, are known for.

2. Flower Braiding & Hair Magic
    With 70 feet of (metaphorical) golden hair, Rapunzel is the expert on floral accessories. She can lead a session on "flower power," teaching the kids how to weave spring blooms into their hair or crowns, making every guest feel like royalty.

3. "I've Got a Dream" Goal Setting
    Spring is for dreaming big! Rapunzel shares her story of courage and encourages the children to share their own "dreams"—whether it’s learning to ride a bike this summer or finally seeing the "floating lights."
