# Calgary's Best Party Venues for Kids

## From Community Halls to Home Events

One of the first, and biggest, decisions you'll make when planning a celebration is where to host it. In Calgary, you have a fantastic array of options, each with its own benefits.

As professional entertainers, we've visited hundreds of locations across the city, and we've broken down the best choices for hosting your perfect Pixies Parties character visit.

## Option 1: The Classic Home Party (Most Popular)

There’s a reason most parents choose to host their event right at home—it’s the most comfortable and personal choice!

<table class="table table-bordered">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th><p>Benefits</p></th>
			<th><p>Things to Consider</p></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Familiar Comfort:</strong> The child is in their own safe, known environment, which is perfect for younger or shy kids.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Space Constraints:</strong> Can be challenging with larger guest lists (over 15 kids) and limited parking.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Zero venue rental fees—you only pay for supplies and entertainment.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Pre-Party Setup &amp; Post-Party Cleanup:</strong> All the work happens in your space, increasing the workload.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Intimate Atmosphere:</strong> Ideal for interactive activities, one-on-one time with characters like <strong>Rapunzel</strong>, and photo opportunities.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Distractions:</strong> Pets, younger siblings, and house clutter can distract from the character’s performance.</p></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

*Pro Tip for Home Parties: Clear a dedicated 8ft x 8ft space in your living room. The performer will need this area for games, music, and the royal coronation!*

## Option 2: Community & Rental Halls (Best for Big Groups)

Calgary has an excellent network of affordable community halls and leisure centres, making them an ideal choice for larger events.

		<tr>
			<th><p>Benefits</p></th>
			<th><p>Things to Consider</p></th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Ample Space:</strong> Tons of room for running games, dancing, and large group activities.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Less Personal:</strong> Requires extra decor effort to feel cozy and themed.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Facilities:</strong> Often include kitchen access, separate washrooms, and plenty of parking.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Strict Timelines:</strong> You are bound by your rental slot—setup and cleanup must be prompt.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><p><strong>Separation:</strong> Keeps the party separate from your personal home life, minimizing domestic cleanup.</p></td>
			<td><p><strong>Logistics for Performer:</strong> Ensure you provide clear directions and a convenient loading area for the character’s supplies.</p></td>
		</tr>

#### Top Calgary Community Hall Venues We Recommend:

- **The City of Calgary Leisure Centres:** These often have multi-purpose rooms perfect for kids' parties.
- **Local Community Associations:** Look up your specific quadrant (e.g., Northwest Calgary, Southeast Calgary) for affordable local halls. Always confirm the noise policy if you plan on loud music or singing.

## Option 3: Specialty Venues (Maximum Theme Impact)

Specialty venues are a great choice if you want the location to contribute to the theme and handle much of the entertainment themselves.

- **Play Places (e.g., Flying Squirrel, Trico Centre):** Perfect for high-energy parties, but be aware that the background noise can make storytelling and singing difficult for characters like Snow White or Hermione. Book a quiet side room if possible!
- **Themed Locations (e.g., Museums, Zoos):** Can be expensive, but offer incredible backdrops for photos and unique opportunities (e.g., an Elsa party at an indoor skating rink).
- **Theatres/Dance Studios:** Excellent acoustics and space for high-energy hero training (perfect for Ghost Spider).

No matter which venue you choose, remember that the key ingredient is the magic brought by your character performer! A clear performance space and communication with your entertainer will ensure success.
