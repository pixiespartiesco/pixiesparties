# 🎒 The Bravest Birthday
## Ideas for a Paper Bag Princess Party
Celebrate resilience, wit, and self-rescue with a party based on the classic story. This theme is a fun, easy, and empowering choice that encourages resourcefulness over material goods.

## 🏰 Resourceful and Royal Decorations
The decorations should feel simple, handmade, and focused on the story's main elements.

* Color Palette: Focus on the colors of the story: brown (paper bags), red (dragon fire), and green (the forest).
* Castle Setting: Use large cardboard boxes painted gray or brown to look like castle towers or a cave.
* The Dragon's Lair: Hang red and orange streamers to mimic dragon fire. Place a stuffed animal dragon or two in a corner guarded by a sign that says "Danger: Dragon's Lair!"
* Simple Garb: Use brown kraft paper to create small paper bag vests or hats for the guests to decorate upon arrival.

## 🐲 Games and Activities for Rescuers
Games should encourage cleverness, loud cheering, and physical action.

* Outsmart the Dragon (The Riddle Game): Write simple riddles about the birthday child or the party location. Give the children clues (like the princess gave the dragon). Every riddle solved is a step closer to rescuing the prince!
* The Dragon's Tail: A classic game of tag or "Wipe the Dragon’s Tail" where children use damp paper towels or sponge balls to quickly clean a drawing of a messy, sticky dragon (drawn on a whiteboard or chalkboard).
* The Prince's Fashion Show: Have the kids grab clothes or props from a bin (must be done quickly!) and dress up themselves to look as messy and resourceful as possible. The messiest winner gets a prize.

## 🥪 Simple and Satisfying Feast Ideas
Keep the food easy and hearty, fit for a princess who just walked through a forest and battled a dragon.

* Dragon Fire Punch: Simple red fruit punch (cherry or fruit punch flavor).
* Knight's Shields: Cheese and crackers arranged in a circle to look like shields.
* Prince Ronald's Messy Cake: A slightly "messy" looking cake—don't worry about perfection! Use chocolate frosting and crumbled cookie "dirt."
* Paper Bag Lunch: Serve sandwiches, chips, and a cookie in simple brown paper bags labeled with each child's name.
