# Fiona, The Princess Who Fights

## Why This Fairytale Hero is Perfect for Your Party

Princess Fiona stands out in the world of fairytales. She's not just waiting in a tower; she's a martial arts expert, a loyal friend, and a strong character who embraces her true self, ogre form and all! If you're looking for a character visit that goes beyond a simple twirl and wave, Fiona brings the fun, adventure, and empowerment kids crave.

## Beyond the Glass Slipper: A Hero's Heart

While our other princesses bring grace and kindness, Fiona brings grit and humor. She offers a fantastic change of pace, appealing especially to children who love adventure, comedy, and characters who are a little less conventional.

## What Fiona Teaches Kids:

- Self-Acceptance: The most important lesson from her story is that true love means loving yourself, flaws and all. Our performer emphasizes embracing what makes you unique!
- Bravery and Strength: Fiona is tough! She's ready to teach "princess safety" (a fun take on martial arts moves) and lead high-energy outdoor games.
- Laughter is the Best Magic: Fiona's unique story is hilarious, and her visit is full of funny moments, quick wit, and playful banter, keeping even the shyest guests engaged.

## Perfect Party Activities for a Fiona Visit

- "Fiona's Fight Club" (Friendly Martial Arts Lesson): A silly, non-contact training session where she teaches how to defend yourself from dragons and overly enthusiastic kings.
- Swamp Storytime: Gathering the kids to recount her adventurous journey from the tower to the swamp, complete with sound effects and dramatic flair.
- True Love's Sing-Along: A high-energy performance of iconic songs from the Shrek movies that will get everyone singing along.
