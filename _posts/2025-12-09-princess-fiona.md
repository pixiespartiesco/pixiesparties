# Fiona, The Princess Who Fights

## Why This Fairytale Hero is Perfect for Your Party

Princess Fiona stands out in the world of fairytales. She's not just waiting in a tower; she's a martial arts expert, a loyal friend, and a strong character who embraces her true self, ogre form and all! If you're looking for a character visit that goes beyond a simple twirl and wave, Fiona brings the fun, adventure, and empowerment kids crave.

## Beyond the Glass Slipper: A Hero's Heart

While our other princesses bring grace and kindness, Fiona brings grit and humor. She offers a fantastic change of pace, appealing especially to children who love adventure, comedy, and characters who are a little less conventional.


## 🏰 Swamp Meets Castle: Decorations

Combine classic castle elements with rustic, mossy swamp vibes to capture Fiona’s dual nature.

- **Shades of Green:** Use dark green, moss green, and brown streamers and balloons to mimic the swamp foliage. Add touches of regal gold or soft princess pink for the castle element.
- **Fairy Tale Forest:** Drape brown butcher paper or netting from the ceiling and scatter faux leaves or vines on the party table.
- **Wanted Posters:** Create "Wanted" posters of various fairytale characters (Pinocchio, Three Pigs) and tape them around the party area for a playful touch.
- **Dragon's Keep:** Use red and yellow balloons or paper cutouts to suggest the presence of a dragon, perhaps guarding the cake or gift table.

## What Fiona Teaches Kids:

- Self-Acceptance: The most important lesson from her story is that true love means loving yourself, flaws and all. Our performer emphasizes embracing what makes you unique!
- Bravery and Strength: Fiona is tough! She's ready to teach "princess safety" (a fun take on martial arts moves) and lead high-energy outdoor games.
- Laughter is the Best Magic: Fiona's unique story is hilarious, and her visit is full of funny moments, quick wit, and playful banter, keeping even the shyest guests engaged.

## Perfect Party Activities for a Fiona Visit

When you book Princess Fiona, you get a dynamic experience tailored to her personality:

- "Fiona's Fight Club" (Friendly Martial Arts Lesson): A silly, non-contact training session where she teaches how to defend yourself from dragons and overly enthusiastic kings.
- Swamp Storytime: Gathering the kids to recount her adventurous journey from the tower to the swamp, complete with sound effects and dramatic flair.
- True Love's Sing-Along: A high-energy performance of iconic songs from the Shrek movies that will get everyone singing along.

## 🧅 Shrek's Swampy Feast: Themed Food

Embrace the humor and the green color palette of the swamp for a truly unique menu.

- **Swamp Juice:** Green Hawaiian Punch or lemonade colored with a touch of blue food dye, served with gummy worms ("mud worms") floating inside.
- **Dragon's Breath Popcorn:** Popcorn mixed with red hots or cinnamon candies for a fiery kick.
- **Fiona's Fight Club Sandwiches:** Cut finger sandwiches (ham and cheese, turkey) into fun shapes using cookie cutters (stars, shields).
- **Ogre Ears:** Donut holes or mini bagels dusted with green sugar.
