## What to Expect During the Paper Bag Princess's Visit

* 🔥 **Dragon Training:** A fun, interactive game where kids learn how to outwit a (make-believe) dragon.
* 👑 **Royal Coronation (with a twist!):** The birthday child is crowned, but the emphasis is on inner strength and intelligence rather than fashion.
* 📖 **Interactive Story Time:** The princess reads her inspiring story, asking the children to help her solve the problems along the way.
* 📸 **Photo Opportunities:** Pictures with the ultimate smart, brave hero!
