    title: Deluxe Party Package
    duration: 90 Minutes
    description: Our most popular package! A fully immersive, extended experience perfect for large parties or those who want the full character experience.
    details: | 
      The **Deluxe Package** is the ultimate immersive experience. \
      The additional 30 minutes allows for *Glitter Tattoos* (a sparkly favourite for boys and girls) and the prestigious *Coronation Ceremony*. During the ceremony, the birthday child calls up their friends, makes a royal promise, and receives a keepsake tiara or hero cape to keep forever. \
      We highly recommend this package for groups larger than 10 children, as it ensures the performer has enough time to give every single guest a moment of individual attention without rushing.

    title: Classic Party Package
    duration: 60 Minutes
    description: A classic, hour-long visit packed with essential character activities and memories. Perfect for most birthday parties.    
    details: | 
      Our **Classic Package** is designed to be the *sweet spot* for children's attention spans, particularly for ages 3 to 6. \
      It is a non-stop hour of entertainment where the character takes full charge of the party guests. We transition quickly from high-energy entrances to focused storytime and interactive songs, ensuring no child gets bored. \
      This package is ideal if you have other activities planned (like a bouncy castle or opening presents) and want the character to be the highlight of the middle of your event.

    title: Character Meet and Greet
    duration: 45 minutes - 3 hours
    description: A simple, seamless way to add live character magic to your event.
    details: | 
      Planning a community festival, stampede breakfast, or grand opening? Our **Meet & Greet** service is structurally different from our birthday packages. \
      Instead of a set timeline of activities, the character manages a queue or roams the crowd to maximize the number of guest interactions. This ensures hundreds of guests can have a chance to meet the character. \
      *Please note: This option does not include games, crafts, or audio equipment.*
