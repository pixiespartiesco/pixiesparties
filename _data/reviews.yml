  text: We recently had Pixie’s Parties for our child’s birthday and she was absolutely amazing! From start to finish, everything was so well organized, fun, and completely stress-free for us as parents. She was warm, professional, and so engaging with the kids—she kept their attention the entire time with games, activities, and lots of laughter.The energy she brought was incredible, and you could see how much the children loved every moment. She made the birthday child feel so special, and the whole experience was magical. Several parents at the party commented on how impressed they were too!If you’re looking for a party service that’s reliable, creative, and truly kid-focused, I can’t recommend Pixie’s Parties enough. We’ll definitely be booking her again in the future!

  text: We had a great experience with Pixie's Parties. She was wonderful with all the children and so kind with my daughter who was quite shy around her. She brought plenty of interactive activities. We had really great feedback from all the parents from her birthday party. Everyone had a blast. Would highly recommend!

  text: Pixie's Parties had my kids and their cousins (spanning a wide variety of ages, and both genders) thoroughly entertained for the entire hour of the party. They especially LOVED the ribbon dance party and sing-a-long! My 5-year-old has not stopped wearing his paper crown for the last 3 days since the party. We will definitely be hiring Pixie's Parties again for a future event! Highly recommend!

  text: Having 'Hermione' join our party was fantastic. We had a total of 18 kids, ranging in age from 7-12, and the activities engaged them all in a very fun and focused way. It was a backyard party with a bouncy castle, which was a bit wild, and the visit was just what we needed in terms of providing a structured break from the chaos! Thanks so much.
