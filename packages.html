		<div class="card-body">
			<div class="mb-4">
				<h3 class="text-secondary fw-bold">The Classic Party (60 Minutes)</h3>
				<p class="text-muted">
					Our <strong>Classic Package</strong> is designed to be the "sweet spot" for children's attention spans, particularly for ages 3 to 6. 
					It is a non-stop hour of entertainment where the character takes full charge of the party guests. 
					We transition quickly from high-energy entrances to focused storytime and interactive songs, ensuring no child gets bored. 
					This package is ideal if you have other activities planned (like a bouncy castle or opening presents) and want the character to be the highlight of the middle of your event.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="mb-4">
				<h3 class="text-secondary fw-bold">The Deluxe Party (90 Minutes)</h3>
				<p class="text-muted">
					The <strong>Deluxe Package</strong> is the ultimate immersive experience. 
					The additional 30 minutes allows for <strong>Glitter Tattoos</strong> (a sparkly favourite for boys and girls) and the prestigious <strong>Coronation Ceremony</strong>. 
					During the ceremony, the birthday child calls up their friends, makes a royal promise, and receives a keepsake tiara or hero cape to keep forever. 
					We highly recommend this package for groups larger than 10 children, as it ensures the performer has enough time to give every single guest a moment of individual attention without rushing.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="mb-4">
				<h3 class="text-secondary fw-bold">Corporate & Public Meet and Greets</h3>
				<p class="text-muted">
					Planning a community festival, stampede breakfast, or grand opening? 
					Our <strong>Meet & Greet</strong> service is structurally different from our birthday packages. 
					Instead of a set timeline of activities, the character manages a queue or roams the crowd to maximize the number of photo interactions. 
					This ensures hundreds of guests can meet their hero efficiently. 
					<em>Please note: This option does not include games, crafts, or audio equipment.</em>

					We know every party is unique! 
					If you have a specific activity in mind just let us know during booking. We are happy to swap out standard activities (like the craft) to accommodate your specific traditions.
